## Disclosures

As per the [Obsidian developer policies](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies#Disclosures):

- **Account requirements**: Quartz Syncer needs to access your Quartz repository on GitHub in order to be able to publish your notes. A GitHub account is therefore required, though also implictly expected, if you're using Quartz.
- **Network use**: Quartz Syncer accesses the network to manage and publish your notes to your Quartz repository on GitHub. Quartz Syncer uses the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to access your Quartz repository over the network.
- **Accessing files outside of Obsidian vaults**: Quartz Syncer only manages explictly marked *and* user-selected notes in your Quartz repository `content` folder. Quartz Syncer also fetches the current contents of this folder to compare changes against your notes. Quartz Syncer doesn't write any notes to your Obsidian vault, Quartz Syncer only writes to your Quartz repository (one-way only: from Obsidian vault to Quartz repository.) When [authentication is properly set up with a fine-grained access token](https://saberzero1.github.io/quartz-syncer-docs/Guides/Generating-an-access-token#generating-a-fine-grained-access-token), Quartz Syncer is only able to modify file contents on your Quartz repository. Quartz Syncer cannot access other repositories on the same GitHub account or organization, nor modify any other settings in your Quartz Repository.
