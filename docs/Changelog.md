### Version 1.4.1

- Added support for setting a vault folder as Quartz content folder.
	- This setting is recommended for users with mixed content vaults or users who want to dedicate a specific folder to their Quartz site content.
	- Specific folder can be configured in the plugin settings.
- Added configuration option for specifying publish frontmatter key.
	- The default key is `publish`, matching Obsidian Publish's default key.
	- The frontmatter key is used to expose notes to Quartz Syncer. Any note without the specified key or eith they key set to `false`/unchecked checkbox will not show up in Quartz Syncer.
	- The key should be a boolean/Checkbox (source mode/live-preview mode respectively.)
- Added Obsidian commands for modifying a note's publication status:
	- `Quartz Syncer: Add publish flag`: adds the specified publish flag to the current note frontmatter if not already present and sets it to `true`. This exposes the note to Quartz Syncer.
	- `Quartz Syncer: Remove publish flag`: adds the specified publish flag to the current note frontmatter if not already present and sets it to `false`. This hides the note from Quartz Syncer.
	- `Quartz Syncer: Toggle publication status`: toggles the note's visibility to Quartz Syncer.
- Added support for all embed filetypes that Quartz also supports. This includes the following:
	- Note: `md`
	- Image: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, `svg`
