	- Configurable in Settings > Note properties (frontmatter).
- Improved diff view styling.

### Version 1.9.0

- Replaced Octokit-based implementation with Isomorphic Git-based implementation.
	- This change resolves a few longstanding issues, as well as address a few frequent requests:
		- No longer dependent on Octokit, and therefore GitHub as Git host.
		- Significant performance improvements.
		- No longer suffers from GitHub API rate limits, mostly due to direct Git calls.
			- Please let us know if you still run into issue regarding rate limits.
- Added support for GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, Codeberg, and Self-hosted instances.
- Added new diff viewer in the Publication Center.
	- Split view (side-by-side comparison) and Unified view options.
	- Configurable default view style in Settings > UI.
	- Responsive design: defaults to split view on desktop, unified view on mobile.
	- Synced scrolling between panes in split view.
- Improved cache invalidation for dynamic content.
	- Files containing Dataview or Datacore queries are now automatically detected.
	- Dynamic files always recompile to ensure query results are up-to-date.
	- Hash comparison determines if output actually changed, preventing unnecessary updates.
- Added UI settings tab for configuring user interface preferences.
- Updated documentation.
