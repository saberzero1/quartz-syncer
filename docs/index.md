[Quartz Syncer](https://github.com/saberzero1/quartz-syncer) is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for managing and publishing notes to [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), the fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites.

Quartz Syncer fully utilizes the capabilities of Obsidian to enable features that would otherwise be hard or impossible to replicate in Quartz, like [[Settings/Integrations/index|integrating Obsidian plugins]], such as [[Settings/Integrations/Dataview|Dataview]], [[Settings/Integrations/Datacore|Datacore]], and [[Fantasy Statblocks]], precompiling [[Apply embeds|embeddings]], or [[Configuring a specific folder for Quartz content|using a specific folder for Quartz content, instead of the entire vautl]].

## Installation

Install the plugin by downloading it from the Obsidian Community plugins browser in Obsidian.

Alternatively, install the plugin by downloading it from the [Release Tab](https://github.com/saberzero1/quartz-syncer/releases), or through the [Obsidian42 Brat plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).
